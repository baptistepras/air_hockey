# How to use it ?

First make sure that `pygame` is installed on your computer, then just run `main.py`.

A window will open, select `Jouer` to start a game.
Select `Options` to change settings. You can change the difficulty of the bot, the time limit, the score limit and the window size.

Try beating the AI in hardcore mode if you can. ;)
